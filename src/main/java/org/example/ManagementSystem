Pet Clinic management system

The application will have 4 major flows and several functionalities on each:
    1) For Vets: they should be able to:
        Register within the system (add new vet);
            Vets should have a unique badge id (4 digits generated randomly);
        View all registered vets;
        Edit their details (update a vet);
        Remove a vet based on their badge id (delete);
        Add holidays: any vet should be able to add specific dates as “holidays”. They will not be available
        for consults when on holiday.
    2) For Owners: they should be able to:
        Register as a pet owner (add new owner);
            Each owner should have a unique phone number;
        View all owners;
        Edit owner’s details (update);
        Remove owners based on phone number (delete);
    3) For Pets:
        Register a pet (add new pet);
            Pets should only be allowed if they are linked to an existing owner;
            Pets should have a unique collar id (4 letters generated randomly);
        View all pets and the names of their owners, respectively;
        Edit pet details;
        Remove pet based on collar id;
    4) For Consults:
        Schedule a consult
            The user should be able to pick a vet, a date, and a time for the consultation.
            All consultations take a standard of 30 minutes and should not be set in the past.
            No consults should be added on non-working days (when the selected vet is on holiday).
        Perform a consult
            Based on the vet’s unique identifier, the date, and the time of the consult, a scheduled consult
            should be identified. We can then add details on the vet’s findings
